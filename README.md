# bike-omaha

Android app for viewing bike paths/routes in omaha.  Hoping to make travel by bicycle less painful for Omaha residents.

## Rough Outline
### Design
Full screen map as main app screen
Minimal or nonexistent top bar
Rounded bottom sheet peeking out at bottom with drag handle/expand button (drag handle possibly not viable with phone swipe navigation)
Bottom sheet contains toggles for turning individual routes on/off

### Data
Data hosted on my github pages site in a raw json file
JSON file will contain GPS data in [GeoJSON format](https://geojson.org/). 

### Other Resources
There are a few GeoJSON kotlin libraries available, here's a one that has semi-active development https://github.com/chris-hatton/geojson-kotlin 

Google Maps SDK for Android [supports](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/utility/geojson) loading GeoJSON directly

## Service Documentation

### bradpatras.github.io/bike-omaha/trails.json
 **This is the file that the app consumes**.

This raw json file will contain all the trails, each in a json object. A trail object will has three values, a title, an identifier, and a GeoJSON feature collection json object.

```jsx
{
    "trails": [
        {
            "title": "West Papio Trail", // String
            "identifier": 1, // Int
            "featureCollection": {}, // GeoJSON 'FeatureCollection' object (massive)
        },
    ]
}
```

### 'Back End'
I played with different ideas for generating the trails.json file but settled with a script that will take in FeatureCollection json files, and combine them with a more eye-friendly metadata json file.  One thing i'm trying to avoid is ever having to manually edit the FeatureCollection files.  The GeoJSON data will all be generated by either a converter from KML, or from a graphical mapping tool that generates GeoJSON directly, like [geojson.io](https://geojson.io/).  The only manual data entry that I plan on doing is adding a new metadata entry when I add a new trail and then pasting in a geojson file into the directory.  

Here's what the metadata file looks like
```jsx
{
    "trails": [
        {
            "title": "West Papio Trail",
            "identifier": 1,
            "filename": "west-papio.json"
        },
        {
            "title": "Keystore Trail",
            "identifier": 2,
            "filename": "keystone.json"
        }
    ]
}
```

The combination is done in a swift script in the servicebuilder.swift file.  To generate the output file on a mac you need to have swift installed and located in `/usr/bin/` and then in terminal, run `./servicebuilder.swift` from the `sources/` directory
